# Machine Learning Basics

## 1. Supervised Machine Learning with Example

Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on labeled data. In this approach, the algorithm learns from the input-output pairs, with the goal of mapping inputs to the correct outputs.

**Example:**
- **Spam Detection:** In email spam detection, a dataset of emails labeled as "spam" or "not spam" is used to train the model. The model learns to classify future emails based on the features it learned during training.

## 2. Unsupervised Machine Learning with Example

Unsupervised learning involves training a model on data without labeled responses. The system tries to learn the patterns and the structure from the data without any prior knowledge.

**Example:**
- **Customer Segmentation:** In marketing, companies use clustering algorithms (like k-means) to segment customers into distinct groups based on purchasing behavior, demographics, etc., without pre-labeled categories.

## 3. Reinforcement Learning with Example

Reinforcement learning is a type of learning where an agent learns to make decisions by performing actions and receiving rewards or penalties. It focuses on learning from the consequences of actions in a dynamic environment to achieve a long-term goal.

**Example:**
- **Game Playing:** Reinforcement learning is used in training agents to play games like Chess or Go. The agent learns the optimal moves by playing many games and receiving rewards for winning and penalties for losing.

## 4. Classification vs Regression vs Clustering

### Classification
Involves predicting a categorical label.
- **Example:** Spam detection (spam or not spam).

### Regression
Involves predicting a continuous value.
- **Example:** Predicting house prices based on features like size, location, etc.

### Clustering
Involves grouping a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group are more similar to each other than to those in other groups.
- **Example:** Customer segmentation.
